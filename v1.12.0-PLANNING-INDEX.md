## 🎓 Key Concepts

### URL-to-Schema Generation
Automatically extract content from any web page and generate optimized schemas with AI-powered type detection.

**Example:**
```
URL → Fetch HTML → Parse Content → Detect Type → Extract Data → Generate Schema
```

### Google Rich Results Validation
Validate schemas against official Google guidelines to guarantee Rich Results eligibility.

**Example:**
```
Schema → Check Required Props → Check Recommended → Format Validation → Compliance Score
```

### Content Analysis
Comprehensive analysis of text content for sentiment, readability, and SEO optimization.

**Example:**
```
Content → Sentiment Score → Readability Metrics → SEO Analysis → Recommendations
```

### Pipeline Automation
Multi-step workflows that chain operations together with YAML configuration.

**Example:**
```yaml
generate → optimize → validate → deploy → report
```
