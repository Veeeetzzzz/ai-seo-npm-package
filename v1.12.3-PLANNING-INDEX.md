## 📊 The Problem (TL;DR)

**Issue:** 11 lazy loading tests fail in Node.js environment

**Cause:** Missing browser-specific APIs (IntersectionObserver)

**Impact:** 
- Test suite shows 96% pass rate instead of 100%
- CI/CD may show false failures
- Production code works fine (no user impact)

**Fix:** 
- Improve test mocking infrastructure
- Fix async timing in tests
- No production code changes

**Timeline:** 2 days

**Risk:** Minimal (test-only changes)

---

## 📈 Expected Outcome

### Before v1.12.3
```
Overall: 294/305 tests passing (96.4%)
Lazy Loading: 2/13 tests passing (15.4%)
Status: ❌ Not ideal
```

### After v1.12.3
```
Overall: 305/305 tests passing (100%) ✅
Lazy Loading: 13/13 tests passing (100%) ✅
Status: ✅ Perfect
```

**Improvement:** +11 tests fixed, 100% reliability
